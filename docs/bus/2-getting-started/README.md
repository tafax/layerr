# What is @layerr/bus?

@layerr/bus is a library to create a message bus layer in your application. 
It is completely configurable using middleware. Just imagine your next 
message ðŸšŒ

{% hint style="info" %}
It uses RxJS as internal engine. If you are not comfortable with 
it, don't worry, you can use promise-like async code too.
{% endhint %}

# Why should I use @layerr/bus?

Using @layerr/bus you can create a command bus, a query bus or a generic message bus. Use it if:

* you're using the CQRS pattern. Read the [Martin Flower's blog article](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html).
* you simply want to introduce a separation layer between business login and presentation in your application.
* you need a powerful design to extend a set of classes that represents an action.
