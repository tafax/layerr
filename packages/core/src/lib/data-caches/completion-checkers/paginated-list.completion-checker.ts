 * Defines the strategy to check if the cache is complete or not when we deal with a paginated list
 * that can be sorted and for which we can perform searches.
 *
 * How the list should work to use this checker?
 * - The list should be split into pages.
 * - We can sort the list with different criteria.
 * - We can perform searches to retrieve just some of the items.
 *
 * NOTE: The fundamental assumption is that the pages are loaded sequentially, from the first to the last one.
