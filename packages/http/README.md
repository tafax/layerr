# HTTP

**HttpLayer** is a library to create a request bus layer in your application. You can use
to create an easy-to-extend and powerful HTTP client. \
It is also completely configurable using middlewares.

It uses [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS) as internal engine. If you are not
comfortable with it, don't worry, you can use promise-like async code.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @layerr/core @layerr/bus @layerr/http rxjs reflect-metadata
```
